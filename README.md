# SBTL Shaders

A collection of subtle shader presets for RetroArch. The main motivation is to enhance the look of retro console systems by adding era-appropriate subtle video effects (like NTSC line blur for Sega Genesis), while not getting to lo-fi.

## Goals

* Stay as close as possible to unprocessed image output
* Add era-appropriate effects to represent retro games as they are intended to look by the developers
* Avoid any image alteration which can introduce eye strain
* Maintain modern look

## Non-goals

* Carefully simulate era-specific output screens (like CRTs, crappy LCDs, etc)
* Reduce the fidelity or reproduce imperfections of the old screens only for an aesthetic purposes

## Usage

Clone the repo into the ```shaders``` directory of RetroArch, then select desired preset from the menu.
